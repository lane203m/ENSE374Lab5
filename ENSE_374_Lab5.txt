Lab5 ENSE 374 submission:

This contains the class diagram and first iteration of the ecosystem (placing animals in world)
IN future iterations, it may be wise to split animals into separate classes denoting behavior
For instance, Grass should derive from plant which derives from organism
Wolf should derive from prey which derives form organism

In this version I have not done that, as there was not enough behavioral differences 
from either organism to warrent such abstraction.


main is in the default srs package
all organism files are in the Organisms package

Javadocs were generated.
